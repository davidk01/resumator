<p>I solve problems with software.</p>
<h1>Education</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>USC - M.A. in Mathematics : 2007 - 2010</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>UC Davis - B.S. in Mathematics : 2005 - 2007</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Experience</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Platfora - devops : Jan. 2014 - Present</h3>
<p>DevOps, Infrastructure, Tools, Automation, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>ebay - software engineer : Sep. 2012 - Jan. 2014</h3>
<p>I was part of the release engineering team at ebay local and helped
  migrate the legacy deployment pipeline from Puppet to debian packages that used
  chef-solo for (pre/post)-install logic. Along the way I also built a few orchestration
  tools to declaratively describe infrastructure using OpenStack APIs.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>esolar - software test engineer : Oct. 2011 - Sep. 2012</h3>
<p>I designed and implemented software tools for testing and verification of 
  systems that run solar power plants using a combination of C#, PowerShell and bits and 
  pieces of Ruby and Python. My crowning achievement was a ray tracer that was a few orders 
  of magnitude faster than all previously built versions and helped track down a bug in the 
  heliostat tracking table generation and compression pipeline.</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/davidk01/declarative-tmux-layouts">decmux</a></h3>
<p>Ruby DSL for declarative tmux layout configuration along with command 
 execution and nesting.</p>
</li>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/davidk01/pegrb">pegrb</a></h3>
<p>A small embedded Ruby DSL that is a combination of PEGs and some bits 
  from OMeta for specifying formal grammars. Currently a work in progress. I&#39;m using
  it to learn about parsers, compilers, virtual machines, etc. by implementing subsets
  of various languages.</p>
</li>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/davidk01/oat">oat (OpenStack API Toolkit)</a></h3>
<p>Internal Ruby DSL that strives to provide a declarative way of describing
  virtual machine clusters. I developed this during my time at ebay in order to streamline
  the testing and deployment pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/davidk01/apt-repo-construction-kit">apt-repo-construction-kit</a></h3>
<p>Part of maintaining infrastructure is making sure there is a central 
  repository of software for easy deployment, rollback, and provisioning. For debian 
  based distribution you want to set up a debian repository. This project codifies 
  the process.</p>
</li>
<li><h3><a href="https://github.com/davidk01/rpc-experiment">rpc-experiment</a></h3>
<p>A little experiment with nio4r (non-blocking asynchronous I/O), celluloid 
  (actor based concurrency), and JRuby (super easy deployment) for building a scalable 
  and plugin based orchestration mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li><h3><a href="http://www.buythislater.net/">BuyThisLater</a></h3>
<p>A small web2py based web application for tracking prices on Amazon.com. 
 The interface is a very simple bookmarklet that can be activated on any Amazon.com 
 product page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
