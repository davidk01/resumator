## Summary
I solve problems with software.

# Education
* ### USC - M.A. in Mathematics : 2007 - 2010

* ### UC Davis - B.S. in Mathematics : 2005 - 2007

# Experience
* ### Triggit - operations engineer : May. 2014 - Present
DevOps, Infrastructure, Tools, Monitoring, Automation, etc.

* ### Platfora - devops : Jan. 2014 - May. 2014
DevOps, Infrastructure, Tools, Automation, etc.

* ### ebay - software engineer : Sep. 2012 - Jan. 2014
I was part of the release engineering team at ebay local and helped
    migrate the legacy deployment pipeline from Puppet to debian packages that used
    chef-solo for (pre/post)-install logic. Along the way I also built a few orchestration
    tools to declaratively describe infrastructure using OpenStack APIs.

* ### esolar - software test engineer : Oct. 2011 - Sep. 2012
I designed and implemented software tools for testing and verification of 
    systems that run solar power plants using a combination of C#, PowerShell and bits and 
    pieces of Ruby and Python. My crowning achievement was a ray tracer that was a few orders 
    of magnitude faster than all previously built versions and helped track down a bug in the 
    heliostat tracking table generation and compression pipeline.

# Projects
* ### [aot](https://github.com/davidk01/aot)
Declarative cluster configuration for a collection of AWS EC2 instances. Depends on
   Paramiko and Boto.

* ### [decmux](https://github.com/davidk01/declarative-tmux-layouts)
Ruby DSL for declarative tmux layout configuration along with command 
   execution and nesting.

* ### [pegrb](https://github.com/davidk01/pegrb)
A small embedded Ruby DSL that is a combination of PEGs and some bits 
    from OMeta for specifying formal grammars. Currently a work in progress. I'm using
    it to learn about parsers, compilers, virtual machines, etc. by implementing subsets
    of various languages.

* ### [oat (OpenStack API Toolkit)](https://github.com/davidk01/oat)
Internal Ruby DSL that strives to provide a declarative way of describing
    virtual machine clusters. I developed this during my time at ebay in order to streamline
    the testing and deployment pipeline.

* ### [apt-repo-construction-kit](https://github.com/davidk01/apt-repo-construction-kit)
Part of maintaining infrastructure is making sure there is a central 
    repository of software for easy deployment, rollback, and provisioning. For debian 
    based distribution you want to set up a debian repository. This project codifies 
    the process.

* ### [rpc-experiment](https://github.com/davidk01/rpc-experiment)
A little experiment with nio4r (non-blocking asynchronous I/O), celluloid 
    (actor based concurrency), and JRuby (super easy deployment) for building a scalable 
    and plugin based orchestration mechanism.

* ### [BuyThisLater](http://www.buythislater.net/)
A small web2py based web application for tracking prices on Amazon.com. 
   The interface is a very simple bookmarklet that can be activated on any Amazon.com 
   product page.
